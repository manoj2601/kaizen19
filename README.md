## Idea for 1st Round
### Theme
Whenever we are far from home and fall ill, we face the general problem many times about the nearest hospital and the availability of doctor in that hospital. Now a days, sometimes it happens that in case of emergency we can't find nearby hospitals and even if we find out the nearest hospital, we are not sure that we can find a doctor there. Many people feel trouble or in some cases of accident, many people dies everyday because of this small problem. According to many doctors if we provide medical facility to the accident victim within the golden hour(1 hour just after accident), chances of his/her life increase upto 80 percent. It is a great need of an app or website where we can find nearby hospital, availability of doctor etc.
