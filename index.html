            <p>hello friends,</br><b><span style="font-family:courier">On the occasion of Kaizen 2k19, we are lunching our website and program which is a model of a need Our motive is only to express our ideas and the solution. whenever we are far from home and fall ill, we face the general problem many times about the nearest hospital and the availability of doctor in that hospital. </br>Now a days, sometimes it happens that in case of emergency we can't find nearby hospitals and even if we find out the nearest hospital, we are not sure that we can find a doctor there. Many people feel trouble or in some cases of accident, many people dies everyday because of this small problem. According to many doctors if we provide medical facility to the accident victim within the golden hour(1 hour just after accident), chances of his/her life increase upto 80 percent. It is a great need of an app or website where we can find nearby hospital, availability of doctor etc.</span></br></br></b>

<h2><span style="font-family:Comic sans ms">Prevention of Accidents</span></h2>
<p> <span style="font-family:courier"><h3>1. Always be alert : </h3><span style="font-family:courier">There’s a reason why many workers insist upon that morning coffee. Being awake and alert isn’t just important in order to complete tasks adequately, but it also helps to keep both you and your co-workers out of harm’s way. According to Julian Hall on Character-Training.com, “most of the people who become involved with accidents at work are those who feel sleepy while working.”</span></br>

<h3>2. Don’t rush your work : </h3> <span style="font-family:courier">In many workplaces, time is of the essence. Employees are given deadlines that they must meet, so there is often a sense of urgency when it comes to completing certain tasks. It’s important, however, to take the appropriate amount of time to perform your duties safely. On Arbill.com, it is explained that “it’s natural to want to get the job finished on schedule — or even ahead of time — but with a ‘get it done quick’ attitude, accidents happen.”</span></br>

<h3>3. Wear required safety gear : </h3> <span style="font-family:courier">Many jobs require uniforms. But the jobs that require the wearing of safety equipment are the ones where dress codes are the most important. “A person who works in a factory has a greater chance of being involved in an accident at work,” reminds Hall, “Thus, he should be more vigilant about the wearing of proper uniforms and other protective garments when working. Never take safety to chance so always go to work with the proper dress code.”</span></br>

<h3>4. Follow instructions to a tee : </h3> <span style="font-family:courier">Sometimes, workers get complacent. It’s easy to fall into the trap of assuming that you’re an expert at your job, so you don’t need to follow every last instruction. However, paying attention to detail can help you to avoid making mistakes that can lead to injury. “Don’t take shortcuts,” insists Arbill.com, “stick to the instructions and work with diligence and awareness of your surroundings.”</span></br>

<h3>5. Pay attention to and follow emergency drills : </h3><span style="font-family:courier"> Workers also tend to take safety drills for granted. If they’re not “the real thing”, they often go through the motions carelessly. However, participation in such drills couldn’t be more important. As Hall points out, these emergency drills are conducted for the purpose of teaching employees what to do in the event of an emergency and so that they can avoid accidents.</span></br>

<h3>6. Insist upon proper training : </h3><span style="font-family:courier"> This is especially important if you plan on taking on a job that may present a number of risks. Knowing exactly what you’re in for and how to react during emergency situations is imperative for your safety. “It is stupid for anyone to take on a high-risk job especially if he has not been trained for the job,” states Arbill.com, “Imagine an untrained person doing the job of a fireman? Doing this will not only expose you to a great danger but will expose other people to danger as well.”</span></br>
